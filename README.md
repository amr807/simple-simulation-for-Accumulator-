Fetch-Execute Cycles simulator      
• The goal of the project it is to know how CPU doing
fetch and execute cycle.
• The Fetch-Execute Cycle simulator is like a program that
shows how CPU, follows steps to do fetch-execute cycle
using program counter and instruction register.
What did we learn from doing the project?
• Understanding the CPU’s Process: The project helped in
understanding how the CPU fetches instructions from
memory and execute them.
• Doing it Over and Over: we saw how the CPU keeps
doing these steps, one after another, until all the work
is finished.
• Understanding how program counter and instruction
register work concretely to fetch and execute
instruction.
